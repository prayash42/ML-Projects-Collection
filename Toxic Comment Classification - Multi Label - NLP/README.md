# Dataset Information

The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.

The dataset consists of large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The types of toxicity are:

<li>toxic
<li>severe_toxic
<li>obscene
<li>threat
<li>insult
<li>identity_hate

Create a model which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.
